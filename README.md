## CUSTOMER CHURN ANALYSIS:

Customer Retention use cases,understand the customers behaviour and see the insights.Churn Prediction means detecting which customers are likely to leave a service or cancel a subscription
to a service.

For eg.Lets say in telecom industry,if you are using Vodafone and moved to Jio and then to Airtel,so what are the possible reasons,may be you are on a higher plan i.e. Rs.500 plan a month
This plan may be available with less cost in different telco's may be Rs.200 or Rs.300 or may be the service disruption,even if you are staying in remote areas or in urban areas it can have the coverage issues ,so it helps to churn the customers.

To detect early signs of potential churn, one must first develop a view of the customers and their interactions across numerous channels.As a result, by addressing churn, these businesses may not only preserve their market position, but also one can take necessary ideas. More customers they have in their network, the lower the cost of initiation and the larger the profit. As a result, the company's key focus for success is reducing client attrition and implementing effective retention strategy.
